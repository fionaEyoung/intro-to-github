1. License: 
2. Benefits:
3. Platform: 

Group 9 (case study 4): Open Source Investigation (OSINT)
1. License: they have a public domain so evryone can use it without restrictions  
2. Benefits:anyone is free to use and modify the software, and it is not owned by anyone 
3. Platform: they utilse GitHub 

Group 10 (case study 5): Open source AI
